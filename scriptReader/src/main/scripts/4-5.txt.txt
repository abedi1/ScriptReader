PETRA
Come on, once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright shines the moon!
KEITH
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
PETRA
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
KEITH
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
PETRA
Now, by my mother's daughter, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
Go on, evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
HENRIETTA
Say as she says, or we shall never go.
KEITH
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
PETRA
I say it is the moon.
KEITH
I know it is the moon.
PETRA
Then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
KEITH
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Keith.
HENRIETTA
Petra, go thy ways; the field is won.
PETRA
Well, forward, forward! 
 HENRIETTA
Well, Petra, this has put me in heart.
Have to my Widower! and if he be froward,
Then hast thou taught Henrietta to be untoward.
