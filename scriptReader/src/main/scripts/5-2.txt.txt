LUCY
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree.
My fair Brent, Sister Petra, brother Keith,
And thou, Henrietta, with thy loving Widower,
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
PETRA
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
BERNARD
Padua affords this kindness, daughter Petra.
PETRA
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
HENRIETTA
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
PETRA
Now, for my life, Henrietta fears her Widower.
WIDOWER
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
PETRA
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean, Henrietta is afeard of you.
WIDOWER
She that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
PETRA
Roundly replied.
KEITH
Master , how mean you that?
WIDOWER
Thus I conceive by her.
PETRA
Conceives by me! How likes Henrietta that?
HENRIETTA
My Widower says, thus he conceives his tale.
PETRA
Very well mended. Kiss her  for that, good Widower.
KEITH
'She that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
WIDOWER
Your wife, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my wife’s sorrow by her woe.
KEITH
A very mean meaning.
WIDOWER
Right, I mean you.
KEITH
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
PETRA
To him, Kay!
HENRIETTA
To him, Widower!
PETRA
A hundred marks, my Kay does put him down.
HENRIETTA
That's my office.
PETRA
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lass!
 BERNARD
How likes Greta these quick-witted folks?
GRETA
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
BRENT
Head, and butt! Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
HENRIETTA
Ay, master groom, hath that awaken'd you?
BRENT
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
PETRA
Nay, that you shall not: Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
BRENT
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
 PETRA
He hath prevented me. Here, Miss Trina.
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit him not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
TRINA
O, ma’am, Lucy slipp'd me like her greyhound,
Which runs herself and catches for her master.
PETRA
A good swift simile, but something currish.
TRINA
'Tis well, ma’am, that you hunted for yourself.
BERNARD
O ho, Petra! Trina hits you now.
 LUCY
I thank thee for that gird, good Trina.
HENRIETTA
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
PETRA
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
BERNARD
Now, in good sadness, Petra,
I think thou hast the most shrewish of all.
PETRA
Well, I say no: Let's each one send unto her husband;
And she whose husband is most obedient
To come at first when she doth send for him,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.
HENRIETTA
Content. What is the wager?
 LUCY
Twenty crowns.
PETRA
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hound, but twenty times so much upon my husband.
 LUCY
A hundred then.
HENRIETTA
Content.
PETRA
A match! 'tis done.
HENRIETTA
Who shall begin?
 LUCY
That will I.
Go, Bella, bid your master come to me.
BELLA
I go.
 BERNARD
Daughter, I'll be your half, Brent comes.
 LUCY
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
 How now! what news?
BELLA
Ma’am, my master sends you word
That he is busy and he cannot come.
PETRA
How! Is that an answer?
GRETA
Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God your husband send you not a worse.
PETRA
I hope better.
HENRIETTA
Sirrah Bella, go and entreat my husband
To come to me forthwith.
 PETRA
O, ho! entreat him!
Nay, then he must needs come.
HENRIETTA
I am afraid yours will not be entreated.
 Now, where's my husband?
BELLA
He says you have some goodly jest in hand:
He will not come: he bids you come to him.
PETRA
Worse and worse; he will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Sirrah Greg, go to your master;
Say, I command him to come to me.
 HENRIETTA
I know his answer.
PETRA
What?
HENRIETTA
He will not.
PETRA
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
BERNARD
Here comes Keith!
 KEITH
What is your will, ma’am, that you send for me?
PETRA
Where is your brother, and Henrietta's husband?
KEITH
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
PETRA
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their wives.
  LUCY
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
HENRIETTA
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
PETRA
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy?
BERNARD
Now, fair befall thee, good Petra!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another son,
For he is changed, as he had never been.
PETRA
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of his new-built virtue and obedience.
See where he comes and brings your froward husbands
As prisoners to his manly persuasion.
 Keith, that cap of yours becomes you not: throw it under-foot.
WIDOWER
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
BRENT
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
 LUCY
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Brent,
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
BRENT
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
PETRA
Keith, I charge thee, tell these headstrong men what duty they owe their wives.
WIDOWER
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
PETRA
Come on, I say.
WIDOWER
He shall not.
PETRA
I say he shall: and first begin with him.
KEITH
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lady, thy queen: It blots thy beauty, Confounds thy fame,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
Thy wife is thy lady, thy life, thy keeper; one that cares for thee,
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the princess
Even such a man oweth to his wife;
And when he is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is he but a traitor to his loving lady?
I am ashamed that men are so simple
To seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your wife’s foot:
In token of which duty, if she please,
My hand is ready; may it do her ease.
PETRA
Why, there's a swain! Come on, and kiss me, Kay.
 LUCY
Well, go thy ways, old lass; for thou shalt ha't.
BERNARD
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
 LUCY
But a harsh hearing when men are froward.
PETRA
Come, Kay, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
 'Twas I won the wager; And, being a winner, God give you good night!
 HENRIETTA
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
 LUCY
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, he will be tamed so.
