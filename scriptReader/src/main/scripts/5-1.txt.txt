BELLA
Softly and swiftly, ma’am; for the priest is ready.
 LUCY
I fly, Bella: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.
BELLA
Nay, faith, I'll see the church; then go to my master's as soon as I can.
 GRETA
I marvel Carly comes not all this while.
 PETRA
Here's the door to Lucy's house. 
TRINA
How now! Thou art married?
 LUCY
I shall stare into those wondrous eyes for all my years. 
TRINA
The plan worked! Lucy, I wish thy happiness together.
 LUCY
Trina, I could not have done without thee.
 BRENT
Pardon, dear father.
BERNARD
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucy?
 LUCY
Here's Lucy;
That have by marriage made thy son mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyes.
GRETA
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
BERNARD
Why, tell me, is not this my Carly?
BRENT
Carly is changed into Lucy.
 LUCY
Love wrought these miracles. Brent's love
Made me exchange my state with Trina,
While she did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last haven of my bliss.
What Trina did, myself enforced her to;
Then pardon her, sweet father, for my sake.
BERNARD
But do you hear, ma’am ? have you married my son
without asking my good will?
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
And to sound the depth of this knavery.
  LUCY
Look not pale, Brent; thy father will not frown.
 GRETA
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
 KEITH
Wife, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
PETRA
First kiss me, Kay, and we will.
KEITH
What, in the midst of the street?
PETRA
What, art thou ashamed of me?
KEITH
No, ma’am, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
PETRA
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
KEITH
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
PETRA
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kay:
Better once than never, for never too late.
