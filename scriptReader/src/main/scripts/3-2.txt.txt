BERNARD
Miss Lucy, this is the
'pointed day that Keith and Petra should be married,
And yet we hear not of our daughter-in-law.
What will be said? what mockery will it be?
KEITH
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you she was a frantic fool.
TRINA
Patience, good Keith, and Bernard too.
Upon my life, Petra means but well.
Though she be merry, yet withal she's honest.
KEITH
Would Keith had never seen her though!
 BERNARD
Go, boy; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
Such an injury would vex a saint, much more a shrew of thy.
 BELLA
Master, master! old news as you never heard of!
BERNARD
Is it new and old too? how may that be?
BELLA
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petra's coming?
BERNARD
Is she come?
BELLA
Why, no, sir.
BERNARD
What then?
BELLA
She is coming.
TRINA
But say, what to thine old news?
BELLA
Why, Petra is coming in a new hat and an old worn out dress.
BERNARD
Who comes with her?
BELLA
O, sir, her lackey: a very monster in apparel.
TRINA
'Tis some odd humour pricks her to this fashion.
BERNARD
I am glad she's come, howsoe'er she comes.
BELLA
Why, sir, she comes not.
BERNARD
Didst thou not say she comes?
BELLA
Who? Petra?
BERNARD
Ay, that Petra came.
BELLA
No, sir, I say her car comes, with her in it.
BERNARD
Why, that's all one.
BELLA
Nay, A car and a woman
Is more than one, and yet not many.
 PETRA
Come, where be these gallants?
BERNARD
You are welcome, madame.
PETRA
And yet I come not well.
BERNARD
And yet you halt not.
TRINA
Not so well apparell'd as I wish you were.
PETRA
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kay? Methinks you frown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company?
BERNARD
Why, madame, you know this is your wedding-day:
Fie, doff this habit, an eye-sore to our solemn festival!
TRINA
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you and sent you hither so unlike yourself?
PETRA
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
But where is Kay? I stay too long from him:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
TRINA
See not your groom in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
PETRA
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit him.
BERNARD
But thus, I trust, you will not marry him.
PETRA
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me he's married, not unto my clothes:
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow to my groom,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
 TRINA
She hath some meaning in her mad attire:
We will persuade her to put on better ere she go to church.
BERNARD
I'll after her, and see to it.
 TRINA
But to love concerneth us to add
His father’s liking: You shall marry sweet Brent with consent.
 LUCY
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Doth watch Brent's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage.
TRINA
We'll over-reach them; All for my mistress’s sake, Lucy.
 Miss Greta, came you from the church?
GRETA
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
TRINA
And is the bride and groom coming?
GRETA
A grumbling bride, and that the boy shall find.
TRINA
Curster than he? why, 'tis impossible.
GRETA
Why she's a devil, a very fiend.
TRINA
Why, he's a devil, the devil's dam.
GRETA
Tut, he's a lamb to her!
When the priest should ask, if Keith should be her husband,
She swore so loud, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bride took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book:
'Now take them up,' quoth she, 'if any list.'
TRINA
What said the swain when he rose again?
GRETA
Trembled and shook; for why, she stamp'd and swore.
But after many ceremonies done,
She quaff'd off the wine for no reason
This done, she took the groom about the neck
And kiss'd his lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
Such a mad marriage never was before:
  Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. PETRA
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine with me to-day
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
BERNARD
Is't possible you will away to-night?
PETRA
I must away to-day, before night come:
If you knew my business, you would entreat me rather go than stay.
I thank you all, beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous husband:
Drink a health to me; and farewell to you all.
TRINA
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
PETRA
It may not be.
KEITH
Let me entreat you.
PETRA
I am content.
KEITH
Content to stay?
PETRA
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
KEITH
Now, if you love me, stay.
PETRA
Greg, my car.
GREG
Ay, madame, it be ready.
KEITH
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly bride,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
PETRA
O Kay, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
KEITH
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
GRETA
Ay, marry  now it begins to work.
KEITH
Ladies, forward to the bridal dinner.
PETRA
They shall go forward, Kay, at thy command.
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kay, he must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be mistress of what is mine own:
He is my goods, I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Greg,
we are beset with thieves; if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet swain, I'll buckler thee against a million.
 BERNARD
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
GRETA
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
TRINA
Of all mad matches never was the like.
 LUCY
Master, what's your opinion of your brother?
BRENT
That, being mad himself, he's madly mated.
GRETA
I warrant him, Petra is Keithed.
BERNARD
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucy, you shall supply the bride's place:
And let Brent take his brother’s room.
TRINA
Shall sweet Brent practise how to groom it?
BERNARD
He shall, Lucy. Come, ladies, let's go.
