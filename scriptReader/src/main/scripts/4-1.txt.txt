GREG
Fie, fie on all tired jades, was ever man so beaten?
was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Peter.
 PETER
Who is that calls so coldly?
GREG
A piece of ice: A fire good Peter.
PETER
Is my mistress and her husband coming, Greg?
GREG
Ay, Peter, ay: and therefore fire.
PETER
Is he so hot a shrew as he's reported?
GREG
He was before this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast.
Wilt thou make fire, or shall I complain on thee to our master?
PETER
I prithee, good Greg, tell me, how goes the world?
GREG
A cold world, Peter, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
PETER
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Greg, the news.
GREG
Is the house trimmed and every thing in order?
PETER
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
GREG
Lend thine ear.
PETER
Here.
GREG
There.
 PETER
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
GREG
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech listening.
The car stalled and he was bemoiled, she swore, and he prayed,
that never prayed before, whilst I cried
Many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.
PETER
By this reckoning she is more shrew than he.
GREG
Could be so. Now, is all ready, and all things neat?
PETER
All things is ready. How near is our mistress?
GREG
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my mistress.
 PETRA
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To take my car!
PETER
Here, here, ma’am.
PETRA
Here, ma’am! here, ma’am! You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
GREG
Here, ma’am; as foolish as I was before.
PETRA
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring along this rascal knave with thee?
GREG
Peter’s coat, madame, was not fully made;
Yet, as he is, here he comes to meet you.
PETRA
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
 Sit down, Kay, and welcome.
 Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kay, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! when? Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
 Be merry, Kay. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
 Come, Kay, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
 KEITH
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
PETRA
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kay, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
What's this? mutton?
PETER
Ay.
PETRA
Who brought it?
PETER
I.
PETRA
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
How durst you serve it thus to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
 You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
KEITH
I pray you, wife, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
PETRA
I tell thee, Kay, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
Better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
Come, I will bring thee to my bridal chamber.
 PETER
Greg, didst ever see the like?
GREG
She kills him in his own humour.
Where dost she take him?
PETER
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to him;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that he, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
Away, away! for she is coming hither.
 PETRA
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till he stop he must not be full-gorged,
I have to make him come and know his keeper's call by watching him
He eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night he slept not, nor to-night he shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
I intend That all is done in reverend care of him;
He shall watch all night: And with the clamour keep him still awake.
This is a way to kill a husband with kindness;
And thus I'll curb him mad and headstrong humour.
She that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let her speak: 'tis charity to show.
