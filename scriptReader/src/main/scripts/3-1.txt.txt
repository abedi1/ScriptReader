LUCY
Fiddler, forbear; Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
His brother Keith welcomed you withal?
HENRIETTA
This is the patroness of heavenly harmony:
Give me leave to have prerogative; when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
 LUCY
Preposterous ass, music was ordain'd
To refresh the mind after his studies.
Give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
HENRIETTA
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
BRENT
Why, ladies, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I'll learn my lessons as I please myself.
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
Her lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
HENRIETTA
You'll leave her lecture when I am in tune?
 LUCY
That will be never: tune your instrument.
BRENT
Where left we last?
 LUCY
Here, sir:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
BRENT
Construe them.
HENRIETTA
Madam, my instrument's in tune.
BRENT
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
 LUCY
Spit in the hole, woman, and tune again.
HENRIETTA
How fiery and forward our Merchant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
BRENT
Now, Lucy, to you.
HENRIETTA
You may go walk, and give me leave a while.
 LUCY
Are you so formal, ma’am? well, I must wait, And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
 SERVANT
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your brother’s chamber up:
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
BRENT
Farewell, sweet mistresses both; I must be gone.
  LUCY
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
 HENRIETTA
But I have cause to pry into this Merchant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts are ranging,
Henrietta will be quit with thee by changing.
