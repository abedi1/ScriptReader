BRENT
Good brother, wrong me not, to make a slave of me;
Unbind my hands, I'll give these goods to you myself
Or what you will command me will I do for you are my elder.
KEITH
Of all thy suitors, tell whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
BRENT
Believe me, brother, of all the maids alive
I never yet beheld that which I could fancy more than any other.
KEITH
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Henrietta?
BRENT
If you affect her, I'll plead for you myself.
KEITH
O you fancy riches more: have Greta to keep you fair.
BRENT
Is it for her you envy me so?
Nay then you jest, I prithee, brother Keith, untie my hands.
KEITH
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
 BERNARD
Why, how now! whence grows this insolence?
Brent, stand aside. Poor boy! meddle not with him. For shame,
Thou devilish spirit, Why dost thou wrong him that did ne'er wrong thee?
KEITH
His silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
 BERNARD
In my sight? Brent, get thee in.
 KEITH
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
He is your treasure. Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
 BERNARD
Was ever lord thus grieved as I? But who comes here?
 GRETA
Good morrow, neighbour Bernard.
BERNARD
Good morrow. God save you, ladies!
PETRA
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a virtuous son call’d Keith?
BERNARD
I have a son, madame, called Keith.
GRETA
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
PETRA
You wrong me, Miss Greta: give me leave.
I am a Lady of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of his wit, affability, and mild behavior
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
To make mine eye the witness of that report
In return, I do present you with a woman of mine,
 Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct him fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know he is not ignorant:
Her name is Lily, born in Mantua.
BERNARD
You're both welcome, madame; But for my son Keith,
He is sadly not for your turn.
PETRA
I see you do not mean to part with him or you like not my company.
BERNARD
I speak but as I find. Whence are you, madame? what may I call your name?
PETRA
Petra is my name; Antonio's daughter, a man known throughout Italy.
BERNARD
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
GRETA
Saving your tale, Petra, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too.
PETRA
O, pardon me, Greta.
GRETA
Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, freely give unto you this young scholar,
 as cunning in languages, as the other in music and mathematics:
her name is Carly; pray, accept her service.
BERNARD
A thousand thanks, Miss Greta.
Welcome, good Carly.
 But, gentle madame, may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
TRINA
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
To make myself a suitor unto fair and virtuous Brent,
I am aware your firm resolve regarding his elder brother
I request, I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And, toward the education of your sons,
I here bestow this valuable packet of Greek and Latin books:
BERNARD
Lucy is your name; of whence, I pray?
TRINA
Of Pisa, sir; daughter to Vincent.
BERNARD
A mighty man of Pisa; by report I know him well:
you are very welcome, ma’am,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
 Sirrah, lead these ladies to my sons and bid them use them well.
 We will go walk a little in the orchard, then to dinner.
PETRA
Mister Bernard, my business asketh haste,
You knew my father well, I was left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Tell me, if I get your son’s love, what dowry shall I have?
BERNARD
Twenty thousand crowns and half my lands after my death.
PETRA
And I'll assure him of all my lands and leases whatsoever if he survives me:
Let specialties be drawn between us to be kept on either hand.
BERNARD
Ay, when his love is well obtain'd
PETRA
Why, that is nothing: for I am as peremptory as he proud-minded;
I am rough and woo not like a babe.
BERNARD
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed! But be thou arm'd.
PETRA
Ay, to the proof.
 BERNARD
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
HENRIETTA
For fear, I promise you.
BERNARD
Will my son prove a good musician?
HENRIETTA
I think he'll sooner prove a soldier, but never lutes.
BERNARD
Thou canst not break him to the lute?
HENRIETTA
Why, no; for he hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell him he mistook his frets,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth he; 'I'll fume with them:'
And, with that word, he struck me on the head.
PETRA
Now, by the world, I love him ten times more:
O, how I long to have some chat with him!
BERNARD
Well, be not so discomfited: proceed in practice with my younger son;
Petra, will you go with us, or shall I send Keith to you?
PETRA
I pray you do.
 I will attend him here,
And woo him with some spirit when he comes.
If he do bid me pack, I'll give him thanks,
As though he bid me stay by him a week:
If he deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When we be married. Here he comes.
 Good morrow, Kay; for that's your name, I hear.
KEITH
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Keith that do talk of me.
PETRA
You lie; for you are call'd plain Kay, handsome Kay  and sometimes Kay the curst;
But Kay, the prettiest Kay in the world
Kay of Kay Hall, my super-muscular  Kay,
Hearing thy virtues praised in every town,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my husband.
KEITH
Moved ! in good time: let they that moved you hither remove you hence.
PETRA
Alas! good Kay, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and fit
KEITH
Too fit for such a swain as you to catch.
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
PETRA
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard takek thee?
KEITH
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
PETRA
Come, come,  you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
KEITH
If I be waspish,  best beware my sting.
PETRA
My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
KEITH
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
PETRA
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.
KEITH
In his tongue.
PETRA
Whose tongue?
KEITH
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
PETRA
What, with my tongue in your tail?  nay, come again,
Good Kay; I am a lady.
KEITH
That I'll try.
PETRA
So you may lose your arms
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
Nay, come, Kay, come ; you must not look so sour.
KEITH
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
PETRA
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
KEITH
There is, there is.
PETRA
Then show it me.
KEITH
Had I a glass, I would.
PETRA
What, you mean my face?
KEITH
Well aim'd of such a young one.
PETRA
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
KEITH
Yet you are wither'd.
PETRA
'Tis with cares.
KEITH
I care not.
PETRA
Nay, hear you, Kay: in sooth you scape not so.
KEITH
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
PETRA
No, not a whit:  I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
Thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference. Why does the world report that Kay doth limp?
O slanderous world!
KEITH
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
PETRA
Did ever Apollo so become a grove
As Kay this chamber with his princely gait?
KEITH
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
PETRA
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
KEITH
A witty mother! witless else her daughter.
PETRA
Am I not wise?
KEITH
Yes; keep you warm.
PETRA
Marry, so I mean, sweet Keith, in thy bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my husband; your dowry 'greed on;
Now, Kay, I am a wife for your turn;
Thou must be married to no woman but me;
For I am she am born to tame you Kay,
And bring you from a wild Kay to a domestic Kay
Here comes your father: never make denial.
 BERNARD
Now, Miss Petra, how speed you with my son?
PETRA
How but well, sir? It were impossible I should speed amiss.
BERNARD
How now, son Keith! in your dumps?
KEITH
Call you me son? To wish me wed to one half lunatic
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
PETRA
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world have talk'd amiss of him:
If he be curst, it is for policy,
To conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
KEITH
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
GRETA
Hark, Petra; he says he'll see thee hang'd first.
TRINA
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
PETRA
Be patient, ladies; I choose him for myself:
If he and I be pleased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That he shall still be curst in company.
Give me thy hand, Kay: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Keith shall be fine.
BERNARD
I know not what to say: God send you joy, Petra! 'tis a match.
GRETA and TRINA
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
PETRA
Father, and husband, and ladies, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me, Kay, we will be married o' Sunday.
 GRETA
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
BERNARD
Now I play a merchant's part, and venture madly on a desperate mart.
TRINA
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
BERNARD
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
GRETA
No doubt but she hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Bernard, to your younger son:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
TRINA
And I am one that love Brent more.
GRETA
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
TRINA
Thy love doth freeze.
GRETA
'Tis age that nourisheth.
TRINA
But youth in mans’ eyes that flourisheth.
BERNARD
Content you, ladies: She that can assure my son greatest dower
Shall have my Brent's love. Miss Greta, What can you assure him?
GRETA
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is his,
If whilst I live he will be only mine.
TRINA
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only daughter:
If I may have your son to my husband,
I'll leave him houses three or four besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be his jointure.
GRETA
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all.
I have offer'd all, and he can have no more than all I have:
If you like me, he shall have me and mine.
TRINA
Why, then the boy is mine by your firm promise: Greta is out-vied.
BERNARD
I must confess your offer is the best;
He is your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you should die before him, where's his dower?
TRINA
That's but a cavil: she is old, I young.
GRETA
And may not young women die, as well as old?
BERNARD
Well, ladies, I am thus resolved:
on Sunday my son Keith is to be married:
On the Sunday following, shall Brent
Be husband to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Miss Greta: And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
GRETA
Adieu, good neighbour.
 Now I fear thee not:
Your father were a fool to give thee all.
