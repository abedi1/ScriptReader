TRINA
Is't possible that Master Brent doth fancy any other but Lucy?
I tell you, madame, he bears me fair in hand.
HENRIETTA
Ma’am, to satisfy you in what I have said, stand by and mark her teaching.
  LUCY
Now, master, profit you in what you read?
BRENT
What, mistress, read you? first resolve me that.
 LUCY
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
BRENT
And may you prove, ma’am, mistress of your art!
 LUCY
While you, sweet dear, prove master of my heart!
HENRIETTA
Now, tell me, I pray, you that durst swear at your master Brent
Loved none in the world so well as Lucy.
TRINA
O despiteful love! unconstant mankind!
HENRIETTA
Mistake no more: I am not Lily,
Nor a musician; Scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a lady for a cullion:
Know, ma’am, that I am call'd Henrietta.
TRINA
Miss Henrietta, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Brent;
And since mine eyes are witness of his lightness,
I will with you forswear Brent.
HENRIETTA
See, how they kiss and court! Miss Lucy,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo him no more.
TRINA
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with him though he would entreat:
Fie on him! see, how beastly he doth court her!
HENRIETTA
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy Widower,
Farewell, Miss Lucy. Kindness in men, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave.
 TRINA
Master Brent, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
I have forsworn you with Lily.
BRENT
Lucy, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
TRINA
Master, we have.
 LUCY
Then we are rid of Lily.
TRINA
I' faith, she'll have a lusty Widower now, and be wedded in a day.
BRENT
God give her joy!
TRINA
Ay, and she'll tame him.
BRENT
She says so, Lucy.
TRINA
Faith, she is gone unto the taming-school.
BRENT
The taming-school! Is there such a place?
TRINA
Ay, master, and Petra is the mistress;
That teacheth to tame a shrew and charm his chattering tongue.
