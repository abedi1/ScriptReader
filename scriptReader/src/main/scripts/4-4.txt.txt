BELLA
Carly!
 LUCY
What sayest thou, Bella?
BELLA
Bernard is talking with the deceitful daughter.
 LUCY
And what of him?
BELLA
His son is to be brought by you to the supper.
 LUCY
And then?
BELLA
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your command at all hours.
 LUCY
And what of all this?
BELLA
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance: 
take you assurance of him, to the church; take the priest: 
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say, 
But bid Brent farewell forever and a day.
 LUCY
Hearest thou, Bella?
BELLA
I cannot tarry, adieu, madame.
My mistress  hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready for you and your better half.
  LUCY
I may, and will, if he  be so contented:
It shall go hard if Carly go without him.
