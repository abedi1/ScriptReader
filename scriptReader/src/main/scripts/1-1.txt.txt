LUCY
Trina, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
And by my father's good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant, here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincent come of Bentivolii.
Vincent's  daughter brought up in Florence
Shall add to her fortune with her own virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Trina, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness by virtue.
Tell me thy mind; for Pisa to Padua I go, an immense change.
TRINA
Gentle mistress  mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you continue your resolve to philosophy.
Only, good mistress , while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, ma’am, study what you most affect.
 LUCY
Gramercies, Trina, well dost thou advise.
If, Bella, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company is this?
TRINA
Mistress, some show to welcome us to town.
 BERNARD
Ladies, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know;
Not bestow my youngest son before I have a wife for the elder:
If either of you both love Keith,
Because I know you well, leave shall you have to court him.
GRETA
To cart and whip rather: he's too rough for me.
Henrietta, will you any husband ?
KEITH
I pray you is it your will
To make a whore of me amongst these suitors?
HENRIETTA
Suitors? Nay, no suitors for you, unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
KEITH
Madame, you need never fear:
Doubt not his care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.
HENRIETTA
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
GRETA
And me too, good Lord!
TRINA
Hush, mistress ! here's some good pastime:
That swain  is stark mad or wonderful forward.
 LUCY
But in the other's silence and mild behavior do I see
Peace, Trina!
TRINA
Well said, mistress ; gaze your fill.
BERNARD
Ladies, that I may soon make good
What I have said, Brent, get you in:
And let it not displease thee, good Brent,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my boy.
KEITH
Put finger in the eye, an he knew why.
BRENT
Brother, content you in my discontent.
Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company.
 LUCY
Hark, Trina! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
HENRIETTA
Mister  Bernard, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects Brent's grief.
GRETA
Mister  Bernard, why will you lock him up for this fiend of hell,
And make him bear the penance of Keith’s tongue?
BERNARD
Ladies, I am resolved: Go in, Brent:
 And for I know he taketh most delight
In music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
Fit to instruct him. If you ladies know any such,
Prefer them hither; for mine own children in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Keith, you may stay;
I have more to commune with Brent.
 KEITH
Why? What, shall I be appointed hours; as though, I
knew not what to take and what to leave?
 GRETA
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
good, none will hold you. Their love is not
so great, Henrietta, that we not last the time.
Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
sweet Brent, if I can by a fit woman to teach him that
wherein he delights, I will wish her to his father .
HENRIETTA
So will I, Miss Greta: but a word
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle, know now it toucheth us both, that we may again have access to our fair
master and be happy rivals in Brent's love, to
labour and effect one thing specially.
GRETA
What's that?
HENRIETTA
Marry, madame, to get a wife for his brother.
GRETA
A wife! a devil.
HENRIETTA
I say, a wife.
GRETA
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Henrietta, though
his father be very rich, any woman  is a fool to be married to hell?
HENRIETTA
Greta, though it pass our patience to endure his  loud alarums,
there be good ones in the world, a woman could light on them,
would take him  with all faults, and money enough.
GRETA
I cannot tell; but I had as gladly take his dowry with this condition,
to be whipped at the high cross every morning.
HENRIETTA
There's small choice in rotten apples. But come;
since this makes us friends, it shall be friendly
maintained all by helping Bernard's eldest son
to a wife we set his  youngest free for a wife.
Sweet Brent! Happy woman be his wife! She that
runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Greta?
GRETA
I am agreed; and would I had given her the best
horse in Padua to begin her wooing that would
wed him and bed him and rid the house of him! Come on.
 TRINA
Pray, tell me, is it possible that love should take such sudden hold?
 LUCY
O Trina, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible;
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as dear as Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
Trina, If I achieve not this young modest boy.
Counsel and assist me, Trina, for I know thou canst.
TRINA
Mistress, it is no time to chide you now;
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so.
 LUCY
Gramercies, go forward; this contents for thy counsel's sound.
TRINA
Mistress , you look'd so longly on the boy, perhaps you mark'd not the pith of all.
 LUCY
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in his face.
TRINA
No more? mark'd you not how his brother began to scold
and raise up such a storm that mortal ears might hardly endure?
 LUCY
Trina, Sacred and sweet was all I saw in him.
TRINA
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir her from her trance.
I pray, awake, ma’am: if you love the boy, bend thoughts to achieve him.
Thus it stands: His eldest brother is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his  hands of him,
Madam, your love is locked up and will not be with suitors.
 LUCY
Ah, Trina, what a cruel father’s he !
But he  took some care to get cunning schoolmasters to instruct him?
TRINA
Ay, madame; and now 'tis plotted.
 LUCY
I have it, Trina.
TRINA
Mistress, for my hand, both our inventions meet in one.
 LUCY
Tell me thine first.
TRINA
You will be schoolmaster and teach the boy:
That's your device.
 LUCY
It is: may it be done?
TRINA
Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
In Padua here Vincent's daughter ,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends?
 LUCY
Content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
Thou shalt be mistress , Trina, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants as I should: I will some other be
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Trina, at once take my hat and cloak:
 When Bella comes, she  waits on thee; but I will charm her  to keep her  tongue.
TRINA
So had you need. It your pleasure is, and I am obedient;
For so your father charged me, 'Be serviceable to my daughter,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
I am content to be Lucy, because I love Lucy.
 LUCY
Trina, be so, because Lucy loves:
And let me be a slave, to achieve that boy.
 Here comes Bella. Where have you been, girl?
BELLA
Where have I been! Where are you?
Mistress, has Trina stolen your clothes? Or you hers? Both?
 LUCY
Come hither, girl: 'tis no time to jest.
Trina here, to save my life, puts my apparel and countenance on,
And I for my escape have put on hers;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on her, I charge you, while I make way from hence:
You understand me?
BELLA
I, ma’am!   ne'er a whit.
 LUCY
And not a jot of Trina: Trina is now Lucy.
BELLA
The better for her: would I were so too!
TRINA
Not for my sake, but your mistress’s, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, I am Trina; But in all places else your master Lucy.
 LUCY
Trina, let's go: one thing more, thyself execute, to make
one among these wooers: if thou ask why, my reasons are both good.
