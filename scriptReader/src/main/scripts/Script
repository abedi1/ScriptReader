ACT 1
SCENE 1
  LUCY
Trina, since for the great desire I had
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
And by my father's good will and thy good company,
My trusty servant, here let us breathe and haply institute
A course of learning and ingenious studies.
Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
Gave me my being and my father first,
A merchant of great traffic through the world,
Vincent come of Bentivolii.
Vincent's  daughter brought up in Florence
Shall add to her fortune with her own virtuous deeds:
And therefore, Trina, for the time I study,
Virtue and that part of philosophy
Will I apply that treats of happiness by virtue.
Tell me thy mind; for Pisa to Padua I go, an immense change.
TRINA
Gentle mistress  mine,
I am in all affected as yourself;
Glad that you continue your resolve to philosophy.
Only, good mistress , while we do admire
This virtue and this moral discipline,
Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
In brief, ma’am, study what you most affect.
 LUCY
Gramercies, Trina, well dost thou advise.
If, Bella, thou wert come ashore,
We could at once take a lodging fit to entertain
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
But stay a while: what company is this?
TRINA
Mistress, some show to welcome us to town.
 BERNARD
Ladies, importune me no farther,
For how I firmly am resolved you know;
Not bestow my youngest son before I have a wife for the elder:
If either of you both love Keith,
Because I know you well, leave shall you have to court him.
GRETA
[Aside] To cart and whip rather: he's too rough for me.
Henrietta, will you any husband ?
KEITH
I pray you is it your will
To make a whore of me amongst these suitors?
HENRIETTA
Suitors? Nay, no suitors for you, unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
KEITH
Madame, you need never fear:
Doubt not his care should be
To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
And paint your face and use you like a fool.
HENRIETTA
From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
GRETA
And me too, good Lord!
TRINA
(Aside to Lucy) Hush, mistress ! here's some good pastime:
That swain  is stark mad or wonderful forward.
 LUCY
But in the other's silence and mild behavior do I see
Peace, Trina!
TRINA
Well said, mistress ; gaze your fill.
BERNARD
Ladies, that I may soon make good
What I have said, Brent, get you in:
And let it not displease thee, good Brent,
For I will love thee ne'er the less, my boy.
KEITH
Put finger in the eye, an he knew why.
BRENT
Brother, content you in my discontent.
Sir , to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
My books and instruments shall be my company.
 LUCY
Hark, Trina! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
HENRIETTA
Mister  Bernard, will you be so strange?
Sorry am I that our good will effects Brent's grief.
GRETA
Mister  Bernard, why will you lock him up for this fiend of hell,
And make him bear the penance of Keith’s tongue?
BERNARD
Ladies, I am resolved: Go in, Brent:
 And for I know he taketh most delight
In music, instruments and poetry,
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
Fit to instruct him. If you ladies know any such,
Prefer them hither; for mine own children in good bringing up:
And so farewell. Keith, you may stay;
I have more to commune with Brent.
 KEITH
Why? What, shall I be appointed hours; as though, I
knew not what to take and what to leave?
 GRETA
You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
good, none will hold you. Their love is not
so great, Henrietta, that we not last the time.
Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
sweet Brent, if I can by a fit woman to teach him that
wherein he delights, I will wish her to his father .
HENRIETTA
So will I, Miss Greta: but a word
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle, know now it toucheth us both, that we may again have access to our fair
master and be happy rivals in Brent's love, to
labour and effect one thing specially.
GRETA
What's that?
HENRIETTA
Marry, madame, to get a wife for his brother.
GRETA
A wife! a devil.
HENRIETTA
I say, a wife.
GRETA
I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Henrietta, though
his father be very rich, any woman  is a fool to be married to hell?
HENRIETTA
Greta, though it pass our patience to endure his  loud alarums,
there be good ones in the world, a woman could light on them,
would take him  with all faults, and money enough.
GRETA
I cannot tell; but I had as gladly take his dowry with this condition,
to be whipped at the high cross every morning.
HENRIETTA
There's small choice in rotten apples. But come;
since this makes us friends, it shall be friendly
maintained all by helping Bernard's eldest son
to a wife we set his  youngest free for a wife.
Sweet Brent! Happy woman be his wife! She that
runs fastest gets the ring. How say you, Greta?
GRETA
I am agreed; and would I had given her the best
horse in Padua to begin her wooing that would
wed him and bed him and rid the house of him! Come on.
 TRINA
Pray, tell me, is it possible that love should take such sudden hold?
 LUCY
O Trina, till I found it to be true,
I never thought it possible;
And now in plainness do confess to thee,
That art to me as dear as Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
Trina, If I achieve not this young modest boy.
Counsel and assist me, Trina, for I know thou canst.
TRINA
Mistress, it is no time to chide you now;
If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so.
 LUCY
Gramercies, go forward; this contents for thy counsel's sound.
TRINA
Mistress , you look'd so longly on the boy, perhaps you mark'd not the pith of all.
 LUCY
O yes, I saw sweet beauty in his face.
TRINA
No more? mark'd you not how his brother began to scold
and raise up such a storm that mortal ears might hardly endure?
 LUCY
Trina, Sacred and sweet was all I saw in him.
TRINA (to audience)
Nay, then, 'tis time to stir her from her trance.
I pray, awake, ma’am: if you love the boy, bend thoughts to achieve him.
Thus it stands: His eldest brother is so curst and shrewd
That till the father rid his  hands of him,
Madam, your love is locked up and will not be with suitors.
 LUCY
Ah, Trina, what a cruel father’s he !
But he  took some care to get cunning schoolmasters to instruct him?
TRINA
Ay, madame; and now 'tis plotted.
 LUCY
I have it, Trina.
TRINA
Mistress, for my hand, both our inventions meet in one.
 LUCY
Tell me thine first.
TRINA
You will be schoolmaster and teach the boy:
That's your device.
 LUCY
It is: may it be done?
TRINA
Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
In Padua here Vincent's daughter ,
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends?
 LUCY
Content thee, for I have it full.
We have not yet been seen in any house,
Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
Thou shalt be mistress , Trina, in my stead,
Keep house and port and servants as I should: I will some other be
'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Trina, at once take my hat and cloak:
 When Bella comes, she  waits on thee; but I will charm her  to keep her  tongue.
TRINA
So had you need. It your pleasure is, and I am obedient;
For so your father charged me, 'Be serviceable to my daughter,' quoth he,
Although I think 'twas in another sense;
I am content to be Lucy, because I love Lucy.
 LUCY
Trina, be so, because Lucy loves:
And let me be a slave, to achieve that boy.
 Here comes Bella. Where have you been, girl?
BELLA
Where have I been! Where are you?
Mistress, has Trina stolen your clothes? Or you hers? Both?
 LUCY
Come hither, girl: 'tis no time to jest.
Trina here, to save my life, puts my apparel and countenance on,
And I for my escape have put on hers;
For in a quarrel since I came ashore
I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
Wait you on her, I charge you, while I make way from hence:
You understand me?
BELLA
I, ma’am!   ne'er a whit.
 LUCY
And not a jot of Trina: Trina is now Lucy.
BELLA
The better for her: would I were so too!
TRINA
Not for my sake, but your mistress’s, I advise
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
When I am alone, I am Trina; But in all places else your master Lucy.
 LUCY
Trina, let's go: one thing more, thyself execute, to make
one among these wooers: if thou ask why, my reasons are both good.
 SCENE 2
 PETRA
Verona, I take my leave to see my friends in Padua,
My best friend, Henrietta; and I think this is her house. Here, Greg; knock.
GREG
Whom should I knock, madame? Has someone rebused your worship?
PETRA
  I say, knock me here soundly.
GREG
Knock you here, madame! What am I that I should knock you here, madame?
PETRA
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate. Rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
GREG
I should knock you first, and then I know after who comes by the worst.
PETRA
Will it not be? You'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sing it.
 GREG
Help, masters, help! my mistress is mad.
PETRA
Now, knock when I bid you!
 HENRIETTA
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Greg!
and my good friend Petra! How do you all at Verona?
PETRA
Henrietta, come you to part the fray?
HENRIETTA
Welcome, Petra! Rise, Greg: we will compound this quarrel.
GREG
If this be not a lawful case for me to leave her
service, look you, madame, she bid me knock her:
was it fit for a servant to use her mistress so, when she is wrong in the head?
I should had knock'd at first.
PETRA
A senseless villain! Good Henrietta,
I bade he knock upon your gate and could not get him to do it.
GREG
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
words plain, 'Knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
PETRA
Be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
HENRIETTA
Petra, patience; I am Greg's pledge:
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Greg.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua from old Verona?
PETRA
Such wind as scatters young women through the world,
To seek their fortunes farther than at home. But in a few,
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
To wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse and goods at home, so am come abroad to see the world.
HENRIETTA
Petra, shall I come roundly to thee and wish a shrewd ill-favour'd husband?
I'll promise thee he shall be very rich but thou'rt too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to him.
PETRA
Miss Henrietta, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petra's husband,
Be he as foul, old, curst, shrewd or worse,
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
GREG
She tells you flatly what her mind is:
Nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.
HENRIETTA
Petra, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petra, help thee to a husband
With wealth enough and young:
His only fault, is that he is intolerable and shrewd.
Were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed him for a mine of gold.
PETRA
Henrietta, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me his father’s name and 'tis enough;
For I will board him, though he chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
HENRIETTA
His father is Bernard Minola, a courteous gentleman:
His name is Keith Minola, renown'd for his scolding tongue.
PETRA
I know his father, though I know not him;
He knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Henrietta, till I see him;
Therefore let me give you over this first encounter,
Unless you accompany me.
GREG
I pray you, madame, let her go while the humour lasts.
He knew him as well as I do, he
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
He stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
his face. You know him not, madame.
HENRIETTA
Tarry, Petra, I must go with thee,
For in Bernard's keep my treasure is:
His youngest son, handsome Brent,
Withheld from me and other suitors,
Supposing it impossible for those defects,
That ever Keith be woo'd; Therefore Bernard ordered,
That none shall have access unto Brent
Till Keith the shrew have got a wife.
GREG
Keith the shrew! Of all titles the worst.
HENRIETTA
Now shall my friend Petra do me Greg,
And offer me disguised in robes
To old Bernard as schoolmaster in music, to instruct Brent;
That so I may have leave to court him by himself.
GREG
Here's no knavery! To beguile the old folks,
the young folks lay their heads together!
 Master, master, look about you: who goes there?
HENRIETTA
Peace, Greg! it is the rival of my love. Petra, stand by a while.
GREG
  An amorous woman!
GRETA
  O, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, madame: I'll have them very fairly bound:
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to him:
You understand me: over and beside Mister Bernard's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too. What will you read to him?
 LUCY
Whate'er I read to him, I'll plead for you
As firmly as yourself were still in place:
Yea, perhaps with more successful words than you
Unless you were a scholar, miss.
GRETA
O what a thing this learning is!
GREG
  O this moron!
PETRA
  Peace, boy!
HENRIETTA
  Greg, shush! God save you, Greta.
GRETA
And you are well met, Henrietta.
Trow you whither I am going? To Bernard Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Brent:
And I have lighted well on this well read young woman, for learning and behavior.
HENRIETTA
'Tis well; and I have met a woman
Hath promised me to a fine musician to instruct our master;
Shall I no whit be behind in duty to my beloved Brent.
GRETA
Beloved of me; my deeds shall prove.
GREG
 And his bags shall prove.
HENRIETTA
Greta, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, I'll tell you news good for either.
  Here is a woman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement to her liking, will undertake to woo curst Keith,
And to marry him, if his dowry please.
GRETA
Henrietta, have you told her all his faults?
PETRA
I know he is an irksome brawling scold: If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
GRETA
No, say'st me so, friend? Where from?
PETRA
Born in Verona, old Antonio's daughter:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me; And I do hope good long days.
GRETA
O madame, such a life, with such a husband, were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't: You shall have me assisting you in all.
Will you woo this wild-cat?
PETRA
Will I live?
GREG
Will she woo him? ay, or I'll hang him.
PETRA
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
GREG
For she fears none.
GRETA
Henrietta, hark: This lady is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for all our good.
HENRIETTA
I promised we would bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.
GRETA
We will, provided that she win him.
GREG
I would I were as sure.
 TRINA
Ladies, God save you. If I may be bold, tell me,
Which is the readiest way to the house of Mister Bernard Minola?
BELLA
He that has the two fair sons, you mean?
TRINA
Even he, Bella.
GRETA
Hark you, madame; you mean not him to--
TRINA
Perhaps, her and him, madame: what have you to do?
PETRA
Not he that chides, I pray.
TRINA
I love no chiders, madame. Bella, let's away.
 LUCY
Well begun, Trina.
HENRIETTA
Sir, a word ere you go; Are you a suitor to the boy you talk of?
TRINA
And if I be, madame, is it any offence?
GRETA
No; if without more words you will go.
TRINA
Why, madame, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?
GRETA
But so is not she.
TRINA
For what reason, I beseech you?
GRETA
That he's the choice love of Miss Greta.
HENRIETTA
That he's the chosen of Miss Henrietta.
TRINA
Softly, my masters! hear me with patience.
He may more suitors have and me for one.
Helen of Troy had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Brent have:
GRETA
What! this gentlewoman will out-talk us all.
 LUCY
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
PETRA
Henrietta, to what end are all these words?
HENRIETTA
Ma’am, let me be so bold, did you see Bernard's son?
TRINA
No, ma’am; but hear I do that she hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.
PETRA
Ma’am, ma’am, the first's for me; let him go by.
GRETA
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules.
PETRA
(to Trina) The youngest son whom you hearken for
His father keeps from suitors, and will not promise him to any woman
Until the elder brother first be wed.
TRINA
If it be so, madame, that you are the woman
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you do this feat, whose hap shall be to have him
Will not so Gregless be to be ingrate.
HENRIETTA
Madame, you say well; Since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this lady for her aid.
TRINA
Madame, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress's health,
Adversaries in love, but drink as friends.
GREG and BELLA
O excellent motion!
HENRIETTA
The motion's good indeed. Petra, I shall buy yours.
 ACT 2
SCENE 1
 BRENT
Good brother, wrong me not, to make a slave of me;
Unbind my hands, I'll give these goods to you myself
Or what you will command me will I do for you are my elder.
KEITH
Of all thy suitors, tell whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
BRENT
Believe me, brother, of all the maids alive
I never yet beheld that which I could fancy more than any other.
KEITH
Minion, thou liest. Is't not Henrietta?
BRENT
If you affect her, I'll plead for you myself.
KEITH
O you fancy riches more: have Greta to keep you fair.
BRENT
Is it for her you envy me so?
Nay then you jest, I prithee, brother Keith, untie my hands.
KEITH
If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
 BERNARD
Why, how now! whence grows this insolence?
Brent, stand aside. Poor boy! meddle not with him. For shame,
Thou devilish spirit, Why dost thou wrong him that did ne'er wrong thee?
KEITH
His silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
 BERNARD
In my sight? Brent, get thee in.
 KEITH
What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
He is your treasure. Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
Till I can find occasion of revenge.
 BERNARD
Was ever lord thus grieved as I? But who comes here?
 GRETA
Good morrow, neighbour Bernard.
BERNARD
Good morrow. God save you, ladies!
PETRA
And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a virtuous son call’d Keith?
BERNARD
I have a son, madame, called Keith.
GRETA
You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
PETRA
You wrong me, Miss Greta: give me leave.
I am a Lady of Verona, sir,
That, hearing of his wit, affability, and mild behavior
Am bold to show myself a forward guest
To make mine eye the witness of that report
In return, I do present you with a woman of mine,
 Cunning in music and the mathematics,
To instruct him fully in those sciences,
Whereof I know he is not ignorant:
Her name is Lily, born in Mantua.
BERNARD
You're both welcome, madame; But for my son Keith,
He is sadly not for your turn.
PETRA
I see you do not mean to part with him or you like not my company.
BERNARD
I speak but as I find. Whence are you, madame? what may I call your name?
PETRA
Petra is my name; Antonio's daughter, a man known throughout Italy.
BERNARD
I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
GRETA
Saving your tale, Petra, I pray,
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too.
PETRA
O, pardon me, Greta.
GRETA
Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, freely give unto you this young scholar,
 as cunning in languages, as the other in music and mathematics:
her name is Carly; pray, accept her service.
BERNARD
A thousand thanks, Miss Greta.
Welcome, good Carly.
 But, gentle madame, may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
TRINA
Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
To make myself a suitor unto fair and virtuous Brent,
I am aware your firm resolve regarding his elder brother
I request, I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
And, toward the education of your sons,
I here bestow this valuable packet of Greek and Latin books:
BERNARD
Lucy is your name; of whence, I pray?
TRINA
Of Pisa, sir; daughter to Vincent.
BERNARD
A mighty man of Pisa; by report I know him well:
you are very welcome, ma’am,
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
You shall go see your pupils presently.
Holla, within!
 Sirrah, lead these ladies to my sons and bid them use them well.
 We will go walk a little in the orchard, then to dinner.
PETRA
Mister Bernard, my business asketh haste,
You knew my father well, I was left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
Tell me, if I get your son’s love, what dowry shall I have?
BERNARD
Twenty thousand crowns and half my lands after my death.
PETRA
And I'll assure him of all my lands and leases whatsoever if he survives me:
Let specialties be drawn between us to be kept on either hand.
BERNARD
Ay, when his love is well obtain'd
PETRA
Why, that is nothing: for I am as peremptory as he proud-minded;
I am rough and woo not like a babe.
BERNARD
Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed! But be thou arm'd.
PETRA
Ay, to the proof.
 BERNARD
How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
HENRIETTA
For fear, I promise you.
BERNARD
Will my son prove a good musician?
HENRIETTA
I think he'll sooner prove a soldier, but never lutes.
BERNARD
Thou canst not break him to the lute?
HENRIETTA
Why, no; for he hath broke the lute to me.
I did but tell him he mistook his frets,
'Frets, call you these?' quoth he; 'I'll fume with them:'
And, with that word, he struck me on the head.
PETRA
Now, by the world, I love him ten times more:
O, how I long to have some chat with him!
BERNARD
Well, be not so discomfited: proceed in practice with my younger son;
Petra, will you go with us, or shall I send Keith to you?
PETRA
I pray you do.
 I will attend him here,
And woo him with some spirit when he comes.
If he do bid me pack, I'll give him thanks,
As though he bid me stay by him a week:
If he deny to wed, I'll crave the day
When we be married. Here he comes.
 Good morrow, Kay; for that's your name, I hear.
KEITH
Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
They call me Keith that do talk of me.
PETRA
You lie; for you are call'd plain Kay, handsome Kay  and sometimes Kay the curst;
But Kay, the prettiest Kay in the world
Kay of Kay Hall, my super-muscular  Kay,
Hearing thy virtues praised in every town,
Myself am moved to woo thee for my husband.
KEITH
Moved ! in good time: let they that moved you hither remove you hence.
PETRA
Alas! good Kay, I will not burden thee;
For, knowing thee to be but young and fit
KEITH
Too fit for such a swain as you to catch.
Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
PETRA
O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard takek thee?
KEITH
Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
PETRA
Come, come,  you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
KEITH
If I be waspish,  best beware my sting.
PETRA
My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
KEITH
Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
PETRA
Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.
KEITH
In his tongue.
PETRA
Whose tongue?
KEITH
Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
PETRA
What, with my tongue in your tail?  nay, come again,
Good Kay; I am a lady.
KEITH
That I'll try.  (raises a hand to strike her)
PETRA
So you may lose your arms
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
Nay, come, Kay, come ; you must not look so sour.
KEITH
It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
PETRA
Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
KEITH
There is, there is.
PETRA
Then show it me.
KEITH
Had I a glass, I would.
PETRA
What, you mean my face?
KEITH
Well aim'd of such a young one.
PETRA
Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
KEITH
Yet you are wither'd.
PETRA
'Tis with cares.
KEITH
I care not.
PETRA
Nay, hear you, Kay: in sooth you scape not so.
KEITH
I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
PETRA
No, not a whit:  I find you passing gentle.
'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
And now I find report a very liar;
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
Thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
With gentle conference. Why does the world report that Kay doth limp?
O slanderous world!
KEITH
Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
PETRA
Did ever Apollo so become a grove
As Kay this chamber with his princely gait?
KEITH
Where did you study all this goodly speech?
PETRA
It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
KEITH
A witty mother! witless else her daughter.
PETRA
Am I not wise?
KEITH
Yes; keep you warm.
PETRA
Marry, so I mean, sweet Keith, in thy bed:
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
That you shall be my husband; your dowry 'greed on;
Now, Kay, I am a wife for your turn;
Thou must be married to no woman but me;
For I am she am born to tame you Kay,
And bring you from a wild Kay to a domestic Kay
Here comes your father: never make denial.
 BERNARD
Now, Miss Petra, how speed you with my son?
PETRA
How but well, sir? It were impossible I should speed amiss.
BERNARD
How now, son Keith! in your dumps?
KEITH
Call you me son? To wish me wed to one half lunatic
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
PETRA
Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world have talk'd amiss of him:
If he be curst, it is for policy,
To conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
KEITH
I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
GRETA
Hark, Petra; he says he'll see thee hang'd first.
TRINA
Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
PETRA
Be patient, ladies; I choose him for myself:
If he and I be pleased, what's that to you?
'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
That he shall still be curst in company.
Give me thy hand, Kay: I will unto Venice,
To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
I will be sure my Keith shall be fine.
BERNARD
I know not what to say: God send you joy, Petra! 'tis a match.
GRETA and TRINA
Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
PETRA
Father, and husband, and ladies, adieu;
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
We will have rings and things and fine array;
And kiss me, Kay, we will be married o' Sunday.
 GRETA
Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
BERNARD
Now I play a merchant's part, and venture madly on a desperate mart.
TRINA
'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
BERNARD
The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
GRETA
No doubt but she hath got a quiet catch.
But now, Bernard, to your younger son:
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
TRINA
And I am one that love Brent more.
GRETA
Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
TRINA
Thy love doth freeze.
GRETA
'Tis age that nourisheth.
TRINA
But youth in mans’ eyes that flourisheth.
BERNARD
Content you, ladies: She that can assure my son greatest dower
Shall have my Brent's love. Miss Greta, What can you assure him?
GRETA
First, as you know, my house within the city
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
And if I die to-morrow, this is his,
If whilst I live he will be only mine.
TRINA
That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
I am my father's heir and only daughter:
If I may have your son to my husband,
I'll leave him houses three or four besides two thousand ducats by the year
Of fruitful land, all which shall be his jointure.
GRETA
Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
My land amounts not to so much in all.
I have offer'd all, and he can have no more than all I have:
If you like me, he shall have me and mine.
TRINA
Why, then the boy is mine by your firm promise: Greta is out-vied.
BERNARD
I must confess your offer is the best;
He is your own; else, you must pardon me,
if you should die before him, where's his dower?
TRINA
That's but a cavil: she is old, I young.
GRETA
And may not young women die, as well as old?
BERNARD
Well, ladies, I am thus resolved:
on Sunday my son Keith is to be married:
On the Sunday following, shall Brent
Be husband to you, if you this assurance;
If not, Miss Greta: And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
GRETA
Adieu, good neighbour.
 Now I fear thee not:
Your father were a fool to give thee all.
 ACT 3
SCENE 1
  LUCY
Fiddler, forbear; Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
His brother Keith welcomed you withal?
HENRIETTA
This is the patroness of heavenly harmony:
Give me leave to have prerogative; when in music we have spent an hour,
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
 LUCY
Preposterous ass, music was ordain'd
To refresh the mind after his studies.
Give me leave to read philosophy,
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
HENRIETTA
Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
BRENT
Why, ladies, you do me double wrong,
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
I'll learn my lessons as I please myself.
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
Her lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
HENRIETTA
You'll leave her lecture when I am in tune?
 LUCY
That will be never: tune your instrument.
BRENT
Where left we last?
 LUCY
Here, sir:
'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
BRENT
Construe them.
HENRIETTA
Madam, my instrument's in tune.
BRENT
Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
 LUCY
Spit in the hole, woman, and tune again.
HENRIETTA ( How fiery and forward our Merchant is!
Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
BRENT
Now, Lucy, to you.
HENRIETTA
You may go walk, and give me leave a while.
 LUCY
Are you so formal, ma’am? well, I must wait, And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
Our fine musician groweth amorous.
 SERVANT
Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
And help to dress your brother’s chamber up:
You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
BRENT
Farewell, sweet mistresses both; I must be gone.
  LUCY
Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
 HENRIETTA
But I have cause to pry into this Merchant:
Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
Yet if thy thoughts are ranging,
Henrietta will be quit with thee by changing.
 SCENE 2
 BERNARD
[To Trina] Miss Lucy, this is the
'pointed day that Keith and Petra should be married,
And yet we hear not of our daughter-in-law.
What will be said? what mockery will it be?
KEITH
No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
To give my hand opposed against my heart
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
I told you she was a frantic fool.
TRINA
Patience, good Keith, and Bernard too.
Upon my life, Petra means but well.
Though she be merry, yet withal she's honest.
KEITH
Would Keith had never seen her though!
 BERNARD
Go, boy; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
Such an injury would vex a saint, much more a shrew of thy.
 BELLA
Master, master! old news as you never heard of!
BERNARD
Is it new and old too? how may that be?
BELLA
Why, is it not news, to hear of Petra's coming?
BERNARD
Is she come?
BELLA
Why, no, sir.
BERNARD
What then?
BELLA
She is coming.
TRINA
But say, what to thine old news?
BELLA
Why, Petra is coming in a new hat and an old worn out dress.
BERNARD
Who comes with her?
BELLA
O, sir, her lackey: a very monster in apparel.
TRINA
'Tis some odd humour pricks her to this fashion.
BERNARD
I am glad she's come, howsoe'er she comes.
BELLA
Why, sir, she comes not.
BERNARD
Didst thou not say she comes?
BELLA
Who? Petra?
BERNARD
Ay, that Petra came.
BELLA
No, sir, I say her car comes, with her in it.
BERNARD
Why, that's all one.
BELLA
Nay, A car and a woman
Is more than one, and yet not many.
 PETRA
Come, where be these gallants?
BERNARD
You are welcome, madame.
PETRA
And yet I come not well.
BERNARD
And yet you halt not.
TRINA
Not so well apparell'd as I wish you were.
PETRA
Were it better, I should rush in thus.
But where is Kay? Methinks you frown:
And wherefore gaze this goodly company?
BERNARD
Why, madame, you know this is your wedding-day:
Fie, doff this habit, an eye-sore to our solemn festival!
TRINA
And tells us, what occasion of import
Hath all so long detain'd you and sent you hither so unlike yourself?
PETRA
Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
Though in some part enforced to digress;
But where is Kay? I stay too long from him:
The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
TRINA
See not your groom in these unreverent robes:
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
PETRA
Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit him.
BERNARD
But thus, I trust, you will not marry him.
PETRA
Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
To me he's married, not unto my clothes:
But what a fool am I to chat with you,
When I should bid good morrow to my groom,
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
 TRINA
She hath some meaning in her mad attire:
We will persuade her to put on better ere she go to church.
BERNARD
I'll after her, and see to it.
 TRINA
But to love concerneth us to add
His father’s liking: You shall marry sweet Brent with consent.
 LUCY
Were it not that my fellow-school-master
Doth watch Brent's steps so narrowly,
'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage.
TRINA
We'll over-reach them; All for my mistress’s sake, Lucy.
 Miss Greta, came you from the church?
GRETA
As willingly as e'er I came from school.
TRINA
And is the bride and groom coming?
GRETA
A grumbling bride, and that the boy shall find.
TRINA
Curster than he? why, 'tis impossible.
GRETA
Why she's a devil, a very fiend.
TRINA
Why, he's a devil, the devil's dam.
GRETA
Tut, he's a lamb to her!
When the priest should ask, if Keith should be her husband,
She swore so loud, the priest let fall the book;
And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
The mad-brain'd bride took him such a cuff
That down fell priest and book:
'Now take them up,' quoth she, 'if any list.'
TRINA
What said the swain when he rose again?
GRETA
Trembled and shook; for why, she stamp'd and swore.
But after many ceremonies done,
She quaff'd off the wine for no reason
This done, she took the groom about the neck
And kiss'd his lips with such a clamorous smack
That at the parting all the church did echo:
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
Such a mad marriage never was before:
  Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play. PETRA
Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
I know you think to dine with me to-day
But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
BERNARD
Is't possible you will away to-night?
PETRA
I must away to-day, before night come:
If you knew my business, you would entreat me rather go than stay.
I thank you all, beheld me give away myself
To this most patient, sweet and virtuous husband:
Drink a health to me; and farewell to you all.
TRINA
Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
PETRA
It may not be.
KEITH
Let me entreat you.
PETRA
I am content.
KEITH
Content to stay?
PETRA
I am content you shall entreat me stay;
But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
KEITH
Now, if you love me, stay.
PETRA
Greg, my car.
GREG
Ay, madame, it be ready.
KEITH
Nay, then,
Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly bride,
That take it on you at the first so roundly.
PETRA
O Kay, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
KEITH
I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
GRETA
Ay, marry  now it begins to work.
KEITH
Ladies, forward to the bridal dinner.
PETRA
They shall go forward, Kay, at thy command.
Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
But for my bonny Kay, he must with me.
Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
I will be mistress of what is mine own:
He is my goods, I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
That stops my way in Padua. Greg,
we are beset with thieves; if thou be a man.
Fear not, sweet swain, I'll buckler thee against a million.
 BERNARD
Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
GRETA
Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
TRINA
Of all mad matches never was the like.
 LUCY
Master, what's your opinion of your brother?
BRENT
That, being mad himself, he's madly mated.
GRETA
I warrant him, Petra is Keithed.
BERNARD
Neighbours and friends, though bride and
bridegroom wants
You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
Lucy, you shall supply the bride's place:
And let Brent take his brother’s room.
TRINA
Shall sweet Brent practise how to groom it?
BERNARD
He shall, Lucy. Come, ladies, let's go.
 ACT 4
SCENE 1
 GREG
Fie, fie on all tired jades, was ever man so beaten?
was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Peter.
 PETER
Who is that calls so coldly?
GREG
A piece of ice: A fire good Peter.
PETER
Is my mistress and her husband coming, Greg?
GREG
Ay, Peter, ay: and therefore fire.
PETER
Is he so hot a shrew as he's reported?
GREG
He was before this frost: but, thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast.
Wilt thou make fire, or shall I complain on thee to our master?
PETER
I prithee, good Greg, tell me, how goes the world?
GREG
A cold world, Peter, in every office but thine; and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
PETER
There's fire ready; and therefore, good Greg, the news.
GREG
Is the house trimmed and every thing in order?
PETER
All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
GREG
Lend thine ear.
PETER
Here.
GREG
There.
 PETER
This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
GREG
And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech listening.
The car stalled and he was bemoiled, she swore, and he prayed,
that never prayed before, whilst I cried
Many things of worthy memory, which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.
PETER
By this reckoning she is more shrew than he.
GREG
Could be so. Now, is all ready, and all things neat?
PETER
All things is ready. How near is our mistress?
GREG
E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my mistress.
 PETRA
Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
To take my car!
PETER
Here, here, ma’am.
PETRA
Here, ma’am! here, ma’am! You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
GREG
Here, ma’am; as foolish as I was before.
PETRA
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
And bring along this rascal knave with thee?
GREG
Peter’s coat, madame, was not fully made;
Yet, as he is, here he comes to meet you.
PETRA
Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
 Sit down, Kay, and welcome.
 Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kay, be merry.
Off with my boots, you rogues! when? Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
 Be merry, Kay. Some water, here; what, ho!
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
 Come, Kay, and wash, and welcome heartily.
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
 KEITH
Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
PETRA
A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
Come, Kay, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
What's this? mutton?
PETER
Ay.
PETRA
Who brought it?
PETER
I.
PETRA
'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
How durst you serve it thus to me that love it not?
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
 You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
KEITH
I pray you, wife, be not so disquiet:
The meat was well, if you were so contented.
PETRA
I tell thee, Kay, 'twas burnt and dried away;
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
Better 'twere that both of us did fast,
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
Come, I will bring thee to my bridal chamber.
 PETER
Greg, didst ever see the like?
GREG
She kills him in his own humour.
Where dost she take him?
PETER
In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to him;
And rails, and swears, and rates, that he, poor soul,
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
Away, away! for she is coming hither.
 PETRA
Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
And till he stop he must not be full-gorged,
I have to make him come and know his keeper's call by watching him
He eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
Last night he slept not, nor to-night he shall not;
As with the meat, some undeserved fault
I'll find about the making of the bed;
I intend That all is done in reverend care of him;
He shall watch all night: And with the clamour keep him still awake.
This is a way to kill a husband with kindness;
And thus I'll curb him mad and headstrong humour.
She that knows better how to tame a shrew,
Now let her speak: 'tis charity to show.
 SCENE 2
 TRINA
Is't possible that Master Brent doth fancy any other but Lucy?
I tell you, madame, he bears me fair in hand.
HENRIETTA
Ma’am, to satisfy you in what I have said, stand by and mark her teaching.
  LUCY
Now, master, profit you in what you read?
BRENT
What, mistress, read you? first resolve me that.
 LUCY
I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
BRENT
And may you prove, ma’am, mistress of your art!
 LUCY
While you, sweet dear, prove master of my heart!
HENRIETTA
Now, tell me, I pray, you that durst swear at your master Brent
Loved none in the world so well as Lucy.
TRINA
O despiteful love! unconstant mankind!
HENRIETTA
Mistake no more: I am not Lily,
Nor a musician; Scorn to live in this disguise,
For such a one as leaves a lady for a cullion:
Know, ma’am, that I am call'd Henrietta.
TRINA
Miss Henrietta, I have often heard
Of your entire affection to Brent;
And since mine eyes are witness of his lightness,
I will with you forswear Brent.
HENRIETTA
See, how they kiss and court! Miss Lucy,
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
Never to woo him no more.
TRINA
And here I take the unfeigned oath,
Never to marry with him though he would entreat:
Fie on him! see, how beastly he doth court her!
HENRIETTA
Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
I will be married to a wealthy Widower,
Farewell, Miss Lucy. Kindness in men, not their beauteous looks,
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave.
 TRINA
Master Brent, bless you with such grace
As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
I have forsworn you with Lily.
BRENT
Lucy, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
TRINA
Master, we have.
 LUCY
Then we are rid of Lily.
TRINA
I' faith, she'll have a lusty Widower now, and be wedded in a day.
BRENT
God give her joy!
TRINA
Ay, and she'll tame him.
BRENT
She says so, Lucy.
TRINA
Faith, she is gone unto the taming-school.
BRENT
The taming-school! Is there such a place?
TRINA
Ay, master, and Petra is the mistress;
That teacheth to tame a shrew and charm his chattering tongue.
 SCENE 3
 GREG
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
KEITH
The more my wrong, the more her spite appears:
What, did she marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
Upon entreaty have a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
She does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
GREG
What say you to a calf’s foot?
KEITH
I prithee let me have it.
GREG
I fear it is too choleric. How say you to an ox stomach finely broil'd?
KEITH
I like it well: fetch it me.
GREG
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
KEITH
A dish that I do love.
GREG
Ay, but the mustard is too hot.
KEITH
Why then, only the beef.
GREG
Nay: you shall have the mustard, or you get no beef.
KEITH
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
GREG
Why then, the mustard without the beef.
KEITH
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
 That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
Go, get thee gone, I say.
 PETRA
How fares my Kay?
HENRIETTA
Master, what cheer?
KEITH
Faith, as cold as can be.
PETRA
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Thou see'st how diligent I am to dress thy meat myself:
I am sure, sweet Kay, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not.
Here, take away this dish.
KEITH
I pray you, let it stand.
PETRA
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
KEITH
I thank you, madame.
HENRIETTA
Miss Petra, fie! you are to blame. Master Kay, I'll bear you company.
PETRA
[Aside] Eat it up all, Henrietta, if thou lovest me.
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
Kay, eat apace: Will we return unto thy father's house
And revel it as bravely as the best.
What, hast thou dined? The Designer stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
 Come, Designer, let us see these ornaments;
Lay forth the suit.
DESIGNER
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
PETRA
Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
KEITH
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time.
PETRA
When you are gentle, you shall have one too.
HENRIETTA
[Aside] That will not be in haste.
KEITH
Why, ma’am, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
I will be free even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
PETRA
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
KEITH
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none. (Designer puts down hat) PETRA
Thy suit? why, ay: come, Designer, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
Why, what, i' devil's name, Designer, call'st thou this?
HENRIETTA
[Aside] I see he's like to have neither cap nor suit.
DESIGNER
You bid me make it orderly, according to the fashion and the time.
PETRA
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
KEITH
I never saw a better-fashion'd suit,
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
PETRA
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
DESIGNER
He says your worship means to make a puppet of him.
PETRA
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag! I tell thee, thou hast marr'd his suit.
DESIGNER
Your worship is deceived; the suit is made
Just as Greg gave order how it should be done.
GREG
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
DESIGNER
But how did you desire it should be made?
GREG
With needle and thread.
DESIGNER
But did you not request to have it cut?
GREG
Thou hast faced many things.
DESIGNER
I have.
GREG
Face not me: I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the suit;
but I did not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
DESIGNER
Why, here is the note to testify
PETRA
Read it.
GREG
The note lies if he say I said so.
DESIGNER
[Reads] ‘One, a loose-bodied suit:'
GREG
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied suit, sew me in
the pockets of it, and beat me: I said a suit.
PETRA
Proceed.
DESIGNER
[Reads] 'With a small compassed cape:'
GREG
I confess the cape.
DESIGNER
[Reads] 'With a trunk sleeve:'
GREG
I confess two sleeves.
DESIGNER
[Reads] 'The sleeves curiously cut.'
PETRA
Ay, there's the villany.
GREG
Error i' the bill, madame; I commanded the sleeves be cut and
sewed up again.
DESIGNER
This is true that I say.
GREG
I am for thee straight: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
HENRIETTA
God-a-mercy, Greg! then he shall have no odds.
PETRA
Well, sir, in brief, the suit is not for me.
GREG
You are right, madame: 'tis for my master.
PETRA
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
GREG
Villain, not for thy life: take up my master’s
suit for thy mistress’ use!
PETRA
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
GREG
O, madame, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up my master’s suit to his mistress’ use!
O, fie, fie, fie!
PETRA
[Aside] Henrietta, say thou wilt see the Designer paid.
Be gone, and say no more.
HENRIETTA
Designer, I'll pay thee for thy suit tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of her hasty words: Away! Commend me to thy master.
 PETRA
Well, come, my Kay; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest clothes:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by lunchtime.
KEITH
I dare assure you, ma’am, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
PETRA
It shall be seven ere I go to my car:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
HENRIETTA
[Aside] Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
 SCENE 4
 BELLA
Carly!
 LUCY
What sayest thou, Bella?
BELLA
Bernard is talking with the deceitful daughter.
 LUCY
And what of him?
BELLA
His son is to be brought by you to the supper.
 LUCY
And then?
BELLA
The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your command at all hours.
 LUCY
And what of all this?
BELLA
I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a counterfeit assurance:
take you assurance of him, to the church; take the priest:
If this be not that you look for, I have no more to say,
But bid Brent farewell forever and a day.
 LUCY
Hearest thou, Bella?
BELLA
I cannot tarry, adieu, madame.
My mistress  hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke's, to bid the priest be ready for you and your better half.
  LUCY
I may, and will, if he  be so contented:
It shall go hard if Carly go without him.
 SCENE  5
 PETRA
Come on, once more toward our father's.
Good Lord, how bright shines the moon!
KEITH
The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
PETRA
I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
KEITH
I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
PETRA
Now, by my mother's daughter, and that's myself,
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
Or ere I journey to your father's house.
(to servants) Go on, evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
HENRIETTA
Say as she says, or we shall never go.
KEITH
Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
PETRA
I say it is the moon.
KEITH
I know it is the moon.
PETRA
Then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
KEITH
Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
What you will have it named, even that it is;
And so it shall be so for Keith.
HENRIETTA
Petra, go thy ways; the field is won.
PETRA
Well, forward, forward!
 HENRIETTA
Well, Petra, this has put me in heart.
Have to my Widower! and if he be froward,
Then hast thou taught Henrietta to be untoward.
 ACT 5
SCENE 1
 BELLA
Softly and swiftly, ma’am; for the priest is ready.
 LUCY
I fly, Bella: but they may chance to need thee
at home; therefore leave us.
BELLA
Nay, faith, I'll see the church; then go to my master's as soon as I can.
 GRETA
I marvel Carly comes not all this while.
 PETRA
Here's the door to Lucy's house. ( TRINA
How now! Thou art married?
 LUCY
I shall stare into those wondrous eyes for all my years.
TRINA
The plan worked! Lucy, I wish thy happiness together.
 LUCY
Trina, I could not have done without thee.
 BRENT
Pardon, dear father.
BERNARD
How hast thou offended?
Where is Lucy?
 LUCY
Here's Lucy;
That have by marriage made thy son mine,
While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyes.
GRETA
Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
BERNARD
Why, tell me, is not this my Carly?
BRENT
Carly is changed into Lucy.
 LUCY
Love wrought these miracles. Brent's love
Made me exchange my state with Trina,
While she did bear my countenance in the town;
And happily I have arrived at the last haven of my bliss.
What Trina did, myself enforced her to;
Then pardon her, sweet father, for my sake.
BERNARD
But do you hear, ma’am ? have you married my son
without asking my good will?
I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
And to sound the depth of this knavery.
  LUCY
Look not pale, Brent; thy father will not frown.
 GRETA
My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
 KEITH
Wife, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
PETRA
First kiss me, Kay, and we will.
KEITH
What, in the midst of the street?
PETRA
What, art thou ashamed of me?
KEITH
No, ma’am, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
PETRA
Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
KEITH
Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
PETRA
Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kay:
Better once than never, for never too late.
 SCENE 2
  LUCY
At last, though long, our jarring notes agree.
My fair Brent, Sister Petra, brother Keith,
And thou, Henrietta, with thy loving Widower,
Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
PETRA
Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
BERNARD
Padua affords this kindness, daughter Petra.
PETRA
Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
HENRIETTA
For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
PETRA
Now, for my life, Henrietta fears her Widower.
WIDOWER
Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
PETRA
You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
I mean, Henrietta is afeard of you.
WIDOWER
She that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
PETRA
Roundly replied.
KEITH
Master , how mean you that?
WIDOWER
Thus I conceive by her.
PETRA
Conceives by me! How likes Henrietta that?
HENRIETTA
My Widower says, thus he conceives his tale.
PETRA
Very well mended. Kiss her  for that, good Widower.
KEITH
'She that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
WIDOWER
Your wife, being troubled with a shrew,
Measures my wife’s sorrow by her woe.
KEITH
A very mean meaning.
WIDOWER
Right, I mean you.
KEITH
And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
PETRA
To him, Kay!
HENRIETTA
To him, Widower!
PETRA
A hundred marks, my Kay does put him down.
HENRIETTA
That's my office.
PETRA
Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lass!
 BERNARD
How likes Greta these quick-witted folks?
GRETA
Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
BRENT
Head, and butt! Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
HENRIETTA
Ay, master groom, hath that awaken'd you?
BRENT
Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
PETRA
Nay, that you shall not: Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
BRENT
Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
You are welcome all.
 PETRA
He hath prevented me. Here, Miss Trina.
This bird you aim'd at, though you hit him not;
Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
TRINA
O, ma’am, Lucy slipp'd me like her greyhound,
Which runs herself and catches for her master.
PETRA
A good swift simile, but something currish.
TRINA
'Tis well, ma’am, that you hunted for yourself.
BERNARD
O ho, Petra! Trina hits you now.
 LUCY
I thank thee for that gird, good Trina.
HENRIETTA
Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
PETRA
A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
And, as the jest did glance away from me,
'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
BERNARD
Now, in good sadness, Petra,
I think thou hast the most shrewish of all.
PETRA
Well, I say no: Let's each one send unto her husband;
And she whose husband is most obedient
To come at first when she doth send for him,
Shall win the wager which we will propose.
HENRIETTA
Content. What is the wager?
 LUCY
Twenty crowns.
PETRA
Twenty crowns!
I'll venture so much of my hound, but twenty times so much upon my husband.
 LUCY
A hundred then.
HENRIETTA
Content.
PETRA
A match! 'tis done.
HENRIETTA
Who shall begin?
 LUCY
That will I.
Go, Bella, bid your master come to me.
BELLA
I go.
 BERNARD
Daughter, I'll be your half, Brent comes.
 LUCY
I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
 How now! what news?
BELLA
Ma’am, my master sends you word
That he is busy and he cannot come.
PETRA
How! Is that an answer?
GRETA
Ay, and a kind one too:
Pray God your husband send you not a worse.
PETRA
I hope better.
HENRIETTA
Sirrah Bella, go and entreat my husband
To come to me forthwith.
 PETRA
O, ho! entreat him!
Nay, then he must needs come.
HENRIETTA
I am afraid yours will not be entreated.
 Now, where's my husband?
BELLA
He says you have some goodly jest in hand:
He will not come: he bids you come to him.
PETRA
Worse and worse; he will not come! O vile,
Intolerable, not to be endured!
Sirrah Greg, go to your master;
Say, I command him to come to me.
 HENRIETTA
I know his answer.
PETRA
What?
HENRIETTA
He will not.
PETRA
The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
BERNARD
Here comes Keith!
 KEITH
What is your will, ma’am, that you send for me?
PETRA
Where is your brother, and Henrietta's husband?
KEITH
They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
PETRA
Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
Swinge me them soundly forth unto their wives.
  LUCY
Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
HENRIETTA
And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
PETRA
Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
And awful rule and right supremacy;
And, to be short, what not that's sweet and happy?
BERNARD
Now, fair befall thee, good Petra!
The wager thou hast won; and I will add
Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
Another dowry to another son,
For he is changed, as he had never been.
PETRA
Nay, I will win my wager better yet
And show more sign of his new-built virtue and obedience.
See where he comes and brings your froward husbands
As prisoners to his manly persuasion.
 Keith, that cap of yours becomes you not: throw it under-foot.
WIDOWER
Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
BRENT
Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
 LUCY
I would your duty were as foolish too:
The wisdom of your duty, fair Brent,
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
BRENT
The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
PETRA
Keith, I charge thee, tell these headstrong men what duty they owe their wives.
WIDOWER
Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
PETRA
Come on, I say.
WIDOWER
He shall not.
PETRA
I say he shall: and first begin with him.
KEITH
Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
To wound thy lady, thy queen: It blots thy beauty, Confounds thy fame,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
Thy wife is thy lady, thy life, thy keeper; one that cares for thee,
And craves no other tribute at thy hands
But love, fair looks and true obedience;
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the princess
Even such a man oweth to his wife;
And when he is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is he but a traitor to his loving lady?
I am ashamed that men are so simple
To seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
My heart as great, my reason haply more,
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
But now I see our lances are but straws,
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
And place your hands below your wife’s foot:
In token of which duty, if she please,
My hand is ready; may it do her ease.
PETRA
Why, there's a swain! Come on, and kiss me, Kay.
 LUCY
Well, go thy ways, old lass; for thou shalt ha't.
BERNARD
'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
 LUCY
But a harsh hearing when men are froward.
PETRA
Come, Kay, we'll to bed.
We three are married, but you two are sped.
 'Twas I won the wager; And, being a winner, God give you good night!
 HENRIETTA
Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
 LUCY
'Tis a wonder, by your leave, he will be tamed so.
