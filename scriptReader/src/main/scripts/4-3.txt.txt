GREG
No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
KEITH
The more my wrong, the more her spite appears:
What, did she marry me to famish me?
Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
Upon entreaty have a present aims;
If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
But I, who never knew how to entreat,
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
And that which spites me more than all these wants,
She does it under name of perfect love;
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
I prithee go and get me some repast;
I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
GREG
What say you to a calf’s foot?
KEITH
I prithee let me have it.
GREG
I fear it is too choleric. How say you to an ox stomach finely broil'd?
KEITH
I like it well: fetch it me.
GREG
I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
KEITH
A dish that I do love.
GREG
Ay, but the mustard is too hot.
KEITH
Why then, only the beef.
GREG
Nay: you shall have the mustard, or you get no beef.
KEITH
Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
GREG
Why then, the mustard without the beef.
KEITH
Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
 That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
Go, get thee gone, I say.
 PETRA
How fares my Kay? 
HENRIETTA
Master, what cheer?
KEITH
Faith, as cold as can be.
PETRA
Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
Thou see'st how diligent I am to dress thy meat myself:
I am sure, sweet Kay, this kindness merits thanks.
What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not.
Here, take away this dish.
KEITH
I pray you, let it stand.
PETRA
The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
KEITH
I thank you, madame.
HENRIETTA
Miss Petra, fie! you are to blame. Master Kay, I'll bear you company.
PETRA
Eat it up all, Henrietta, if thou lovest me.
Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
Kay, eat apace: Will we return unto thy father's house
And revel it as bravely as the best.
What, hast thou dined? The Designer stays thy leisure,
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
 Come, Designer, let us see these ornaments;
Lay forth the suit.
DESIGNER
Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
PETRA
Fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
KEITH
I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time.
PETRA
When you are gentle, you shall have one too.
HENRIETTA
That will not be in haste.
KEITH
Why, ma’am, I trust I may have leave to speak;
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
Your betters have endured me say my mind,
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
I will be free even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
PETRA
Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
KEITH
Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
And it I will have, or I will have none. 
PETRA
Thy suit? why, ay: come, Designer, let us see't.
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
Why, what, i' devil's name, Designer, call'st thou this?
HENRIETTA
I see he's like to have neither cap nor suit.
DESIGNER
You bid me make it orderly, according to the fashion and the time.
PETRA
Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
I did not bid you mar it to the time.
Go, I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
KEITH
I never saw a better-fashion'd suit,
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
PETRA
Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
DESIGNER
He says your worship means to make a puppet of him.
PETRA
O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread!
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
Away, thou rag! I tell thee, thou hast marr'd his suit.
DESIGNER
Your worship is deceived; the suit is made
Just as Greg gave order how it should be done.
GREG
I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
DESIGNER
But how did you desire it should be made?
GREG
With needle and thread.
DESIGNER
But did you not request to have it cut?
GREG
Thou hast faced many things.
DESIGNER
I have.
GREG
Face not me: I say unto thee, I bid thy master cut out the suit; 
but I did not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
DESIGNER
Why, here is the note to testify
PETRA
Read it.
GREG
The note lies if he say I said so.
DESIGNER
 ‘One, a loose-bodied suit:'
GREG
Master, if ever I said loose-bodied suit, sew me in
the pockets of it, and beat me: I said a suit.
PETRA
Proceed.
DESIGNER
'With a small compassed cape:'
GREG
I confess the cape.
DESIGNER
'With a trunk sleeve:'
GREG
I confess two sleeves.
DESIGNER
'The sleeves curiously cut.'
PETRA
Ay, there's the villany.
GREG
Error i' the bill, madame; I commanded the sleeves be cut and
sewed up again.
DESIGNER
This is true that I say.
GREG
I am for thee straight: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
HENRIETTA
God-a-mercy, Greg! then he shall have no odds.
PETRA
Well, sir, in brief, the suit is not for me.
GREG
You are right, madame: 'tis for my master.
PETRA
Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
GREG
Villain, not for thy life: take up my master’s
suit for thy mistress’ use!
PETRA
Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
GREG
O, madame, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
Take up my master’s suit to his mistress’ use!
O, fie, fie, fie!
PETRA
Henrietta, say thou wilt see the Designer paid.
Be gone, and say no more.
HENRIETTA
Designer, I'll pay thee for thy suit tomorrow:
Take no unkindness of her hasty words: Away! Commend me to thy master.
 PETRA
Well, come, my Kay; we will unto your father's
Even in these honest clothes:
Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
And well we may come there by lunchtime.
KEITH
I dare assure you, ma’am, 'tis almost two;
And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
PETRA
It shall be seven ere I go to my car:
Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
You are still crossing it. I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
HENRIETTA
Why, so this gallant will command the sun.
