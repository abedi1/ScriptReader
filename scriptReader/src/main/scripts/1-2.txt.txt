 PETRA
Verona, I take my leave to see my friends in Padua,
My best friend, Henrietta; and I think this is her house. Here, Greg; knock.
GREG
Whom should I knock, madame? Has someone rebused your worship?
PETRA
  I say, knock me here soundly.
GREG
Knock you here, madame! What am I that I should knock you here, madame?
PETRA
Villain, I say, knock me at this gate. Rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
GREG
I should knock you first, and then I know after who comes by the worst.
PETRA
Will it not be? You'll not knock, I'll ring it;
I'll try how you can sing it.
 GREG
Help, masters, help! my mistress is mad.
PETRA
Now, knock when I bid you!
 HENRIETTA
How now! what's the matter? My old friend Greg!
and my good friend Petra! How do you all at Verona?
PETRA
Henrietta, come you to part the fray?
HENRIETTA
Welcome, Petra! Rise, Greg: we will compound this quarrel.
GREG
If this be not a lawful case for me to leave her
service, look you, madame, she bid me knock her:
was it fit for a servant to use her mistress so, when she is wrong in the head?
I should had knock'd at first.
PETRA
A senseless villain! Good Henrietta,
I bade he knock upon your gate and could not get him to do it.
GREG
Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
words plain, 'Knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
PETRA
Be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
HENRIETTA
Petra, patience; I am Greg's pledge:
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Greg.
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
Blows you to Padua from old Verona?
PETRA
Such wind as scatters young women through the world,
To seek their fortunes farther than at home. But in a few,
Antonio, my father, is deceased;
And I have thrust myself into this maze,
To wive and thrive as best I may:
Crowns in my purse and goods at home, so am come abroad to see the world.
HENRIETTA
Petra, shall I come roundly to thee and wish a shrewd ill-favour'd husband?
I'll promise thee he shall be very rich but thou'rt too much my friend,
And I'll not wish thee to him.
PETRA
Miss Henrietta, 'twixt such friends as we
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
One rich enough to be Petra's husband,
Be he as foul, old, curst, shrewd or worse,
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
GREG
She tells you flatly what her mind is:
Nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.
HENRIETTA
Petra, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
I can, Petra, help thee to a husband
With wealth enough and young:
His only fault, is that he is intolerable and shrewd.
Were my state far worser than it is,
I would not wed him for a mine of gold.
PETRA
Henrietta, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
Tell me his father’s name and 'tis enough;
For I will board him, though he chide as loud
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
HENRIETTA
His father is Bernard Minola, a courteous gentleman:
His name is Keith Minola, renown'd for his scolding tongue.
PETRA
I know his father, though I know not him;
He knew my deceased father well.
I will not sleep, Henrietta, till I see him;
Therefore let me give you over this first encounter,
Unless you accompany me.
GREG
I pray you, madame, let her go while the humour lasts.
He knew him as well as I do, he
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
He stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
his face. You know him not, madame.
HENRIETTA
Tarry, Petra, I must go with thee,
For in Bernard's keep my treasure is:
His youngest son, handsome Brent,
Withheld from me and other suitors,
Supposing it impossible for those defects,
That ever Keith be woo'd; Therefore Bernard ordered,
That none shall have access unto Brent
Till Keith the shrew have got a wife.
GREG
Keith the shrew! Of all titles the worst.
HENRIETTA
Now shall my friend Petra do me Greg,
And offer me disguised in robes
To old Bernard as schoolmaster in music, to instruct Brent;
That so I may have leave to court him by himself.
GREG
Here's no knavery! To beguile the old folks,
the young folks lay their heads together!
 Master, master, look about you: who goes there?
HENRIETTA
Peace, Greg! it is the rival of my love. Petra, stand by a while.
GREG
  An amorous woman!
GRETA
  O, very well; I have perused the note.
Hark you, madame: I'll have them very fairly bound:
All books of love, see that at any hand;
And see you read no other lectures to him:
You understand me: over and beside Mister Bernard's liberality,
I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too. What will you read to him?
 LUCY
Whate'er I read to him, I'll plead for you
As firmly as yourself were still in place:
Yea, perhaps with more successful words than you
Unless you were a scholar, miss.
GRETA
O what a thing this learning is!
GREG
  O this moron!
PETRA
  Peace, boy!
HENRIETTA
  Greg, shush! God save you, Greta.
GRETA
And you are well met, Henrietta.
Trow you whither I am going? To Bernard Minola.
I promised to inquire carefully
About a schoolmaster for the fair Brent:
And I have lighted well on this well read young woman, for learning and behavior.
HENRIETTA
'Tis well; and I have met a woman
Hath promised me to a fine musician to instruct our master;
Shall I no whit be behind in duty to my beloved Brent.
GRETA
Beloved of me; my deeds shall prove.
GREG
 And his bags shall prove.
HENRIETTA
Greta, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
Listen to me, I'll tell you news good for either.
  Here is a woman whom by chance I met,
Upon agreement to her liking, will undertake to woo curst Keith,
And to marry him, if his dowry please.
GRETA
Henrietta, have you told her all his faults?
PETRA
I know he is an irksome brawling scold: If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
GRETA
No, say'st me so, friend? Where from?
PETRA
Born in Verona, old Antonio's daughter:
My father dead, my fortune lives for me; And I do hope good long days.
GRETA
O madame, such a life, with such a husband, were strange!
But if you have a stomach, to't: You shall have me assisting you in all.
Will you woo this wild-cat?
PETRA
Will I live?
GREG
Will she woo him? ay, or I'll hang him.
PETRA
Why came I hither but to that intent?
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
GREG
For she fears none.
GRETA
Henrietta, hark: This lady is happily arrived,
My mind presumes, for all our good.
HENRIETTA
I promised we would bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.
GRETA
We will, provided that she win him.
GREG
I would I were as sure.
 TRINA
Ladies, God save you. If I may be bold, tell me,
Which is the readiest way to the house of Mister Bernard Minola?
BELLA
He that has the two fair sons, you mean?
TRINA
Even he, Bella.
GRETA
Hark you, madame; you mean not him to--
TRINA
Perhaps, her and him, madame: what have you to do?
PETRA
Not he that chides, I pray.
TRINA
I love no chiders, madame. Bella, let's away.
 LUCY
Well begun, Trina.
HENRIETTA
Sir, a word ere you go; Are you a suitor to the boy you talk of?
TRINA
And if I be, madame, is it any offence?
GRETA
No; if without more words you will go.
TRINA
Why, madame, I pray, are not the streets as free
For me as for you?
GRETA
But so is not she.
TRINA
For what reason, I beseech you?
GRETA
That he's the choice love of Miss Greta.
HENRIETTA
That he's the chosen of Miss Henrietta.
TRINA
Softly, my masters! hear me with patience.
He may more suitors have and me for one.
Helen of Troy had a thousand wooers;
Then well one more may fair Brent have:
GRETA
What! this gentlewoman will out-talk us all.
 LUCY
Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
PETRA
Henrietta, to what end are all these words?
HENRIETTA
Ma’am, let me be so bold, did you see Bernard's son?
TRINA
No, ma’am; but hear I do that she hath two,
The one as famous for a scolding tongue
As is the other for beauteous modesty.
PETRA
Ma’am, ma’am, the first's for me; let him go by.
GRETA
Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules.
PETRA
The youngest son whom you hearken for
His father keeps from suitors, and will not promise him to any woman
Until the elder brother first be wed.
TRINA
If it be so, madame, that you are the woman
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
And if you do this feat, whose hap shall be to have him
Will not so Gregless be to be ingrate.
HENRIETTA
Madame, you say well; Since you do profess to be a suitor,
You must, as we do, gratify this lady for her aid.
TRINA
Madame, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
And quaff carouses to our mistress's health,
Adversaries in love, but drink as friends.
GREG and BELLA
O excellent motion!
HENRIETTA
The motion's good indeed. Petra, I shall buy yours.
